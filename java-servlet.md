The Servlet interface is the central abstraction of the Java Servlet API. All servlets
implement this interface either directly, or more commonly, by extending a class that
implements the interface. The two classes in the Java Servlet API that implement the
Servlet interface are GenericServlet and HttpServlet. For most purposes, Developers
will extend HttpServlet to implement their servlets.
